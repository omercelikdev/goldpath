# ADR Index — The Goldpath Constitution

These decisions are the constitution of Goldpath (see [foundation](../strategy/foundation.md) §2 —
the first ten; 0011+ extend it by the same process). If one of them changes, the product has
effectively been redesigned; a change requires a new superseding ADR. Format: MADR-lite.
