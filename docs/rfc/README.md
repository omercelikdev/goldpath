# RFC Index

Every module/significant component is born through an RFC before implementation begins.
Template = the eight fixed sections of [goldpath-idempotency.md](goldpath-idempotency.md):

1. Scope / Non-Goals · 2. Seam Map · 3. Manifest Surface · 4. API Surface ·
5. Analyzer Rules · 6. Ops Package · 7. Test Plan (including golden manifest impact) · 8. DoD

This table is COMPLETE by rule: every file in this folder has a row, and the row tells the
truth (the freshness gate keeps links alive; the review agent's R1 class polices claims).
All "implemented" modules are published on nuget.org at `0.1.0-preview.6` (the current train).

| [goldpath-console](goldpath-console.md) | Goldpath.Console (the UI phase) | implemented — U1–U9 met (family standards: `../strategy/ui-standard-v1.md` §7–§9); admin contract at Revision R3 |
| [goldpath-platform-sdk](goldpath-platform-sdk.md) | the Module SDK (platform RFC, ADR-0012 companion) | **ACCEPTED** (2026-08-05, D1–D7 + the §2b risk/antidote condition) — D1/D2/D5/D6 implemented in step 5 (`Goldpath.Sdk` is on `main`, NOT yet in a published train); the two §2b DoD gaps are **CLOSED** 2026-08-10 (`train-freshness.sh` + GP2001/`product-guard.sh`, both running in CI against CorPay); the pilot product module is the remaining open item |
| [goldpath-ai](goldpath-ai.md) | Goldpath.Ai — opt-in runtime AI (gateway · tool registry · decision record · confidence gate) | **ACCEPTED** (2026-07-26, D1–D4 as recommended) — implementation opens after the UI phase |
| [goldpath-messaging-exit](goldpath-messaging-exit.md) | the messaging dependency: measured exposure, options, and the triggers that would move us | **ACCEPTED** (2026-08-10) — option **A**: stay pinned on 8.x, fallback D; a move would be a MAJOR version, not an internal swap. §5 implemented (the publish seam + GP0404); the watch lives as `open-threads.md` T18 |
| [spec-engine-v1](spec-engine-v1.md) | specdrift (separate repo) | implemented — 0.4.2 published (NuGet tool + MCP + Docker + Action) |
| [qorpe-ui](qorpe-ui.md) | @qorpe/ui — the family UI kit extraction (platform-sdk D5) | **implemented** (step 6.0, 2026-08-07): the kit lives in [qorpe/ui](https://github.com/qorpe/ui), publishes to npm via OIDC trusted publishing, and BOTH consumers run on the published package — `ui/kit` is deleted from this repo |
| [qorpe-sync](qorpe-sync.md) | qorpe.sync (separate private repo) — the migration & co-existence product module (ADR-0012's own named example): CDC capture, ordered replayable stream, adapter-based versioned mapping, event-id reconciliation composing db-compare | **accepted** (owner, 2026-08-18) — v0 scope is engagement-shaped (§5.1 by-product rule); build scheduled, two-store rig first; the second-product-repo ordering is an owner decision recorded in RFC D5 |
| [goldpath-approvals](goldpath-approvals.md) | Goldpath.Approvals — human approval workflows: maker-checker, four-eyes, amount-laddered authority, delegation, escalation, worklist; definitions as versioned data | **accepted** (owner, 2026-08-18) — build started same day by owner decision; core + 20 tests + manifest/CLI/template wiring + EF store landed; console federation and the adopter proof stay open (T21) |
| [goldpath-fileexchange](goldpath-fileexchange.md) | Goldpath.FileExchange — file-based integration rails as a unit: scheduled pick-up/drop, format contracts, idempotent `(file,line)` ingestion, quarantine, reprocessing, archival, outbound | **accepted** (owner, 2026-08-18) — build started same day by owner decision; core + 9 tests (planted-fault rig + EF ledger) + manifest/CLI/template wiring landed; transports, console federation and the adopter proof stay open (T22) |
| [specanchor-composition](specanchor-composition.md) | specanchor (separate repo) — the transformation package's deterministic core, composed per foundation §9/§5.1 | **ACCEPTED** (2026-08-16, #165) — the toolchain is real ([qorpe/specanchor](https://github.com/qorpe/specanchor), Apache-2.0; 74 tests, mutation 94.8%, first skill eval 7/7); the composition proof it owes is `open-threads.md` T20 (the rehearsal) |
