# Scenario campaign — every claim retold as a business story, then executed

Status: LIVING plan (owner + agent co-author; started 2026-07-29). This is the program the
owner set: **finish the UI, then walk EVERY capability through real business scenarios,
step by step, nothing skipped.** The unit/integration/smoke gates prove the mechanics;
this campaign proves the STORIES a buyer or an operator would actually tell.

## How this file works

- Anyone adds a scenario with the template below. A scenario is not "done" when the code
  exists — it is done when the **evidence** column points at a run someone can replay.
- Scenarios that need scale hardware say so in `needs` and wait for it rather than being
  quietly downgraded.
- Sector-specific numbers are fine; CUSTOMER names are not (public repo — the private
  briefs stay outside).

### Template

```
S-<AREA>-<NN> — <one-line business sentence>
  modules:  <which of the ladder + cross-cutting it exercises>
  given:    <starting state, in business words>
  when:     <what the operator/system does — step by step>
  then:     <what must be observably true, including on the CONSOLE>
  needs:    <local | scale-rig (spec) | second-service | nothing special>
  evidence: <empty until the run exists: script/test name + where its output lives>
```

## Phase order (the owner's sequence)

1. **UI finalization** — the owner's style feedback batches on the live console +
   campaign R1's governor fields. UI is DONE when the owner says so, not before.
2. **Scenario execution** — the table below, top to bottom, each scenario driven for
   real and its evidence linked.
3. **Scale block last** — the 30M-class scenarios on a sized rig, because their numbers
   only mean something once the functional stories all pass.

## Seeded scenarios (v0 — owner extends)

S-FLEET-01 — A 2.3M-device config push finishes in five working days without melting anything
  modules:  campaign (R1 fields), jobs, console governor
  given:    2.3M enumerable targets; policy tps=800, dailyQuota=500000, window 10:00-21:00
            Europe/Istanbul, excludedDays=[Sat,Sun], endDate=+7d
  when:     operator creates the campaign, watches day 1, throttles to 300 mid-day when the
            downstream complains, restores to 800, lets it run
  then:     daily released never exceeds the quota; nothing releases outside the window or
            on the weekend; the governor shows the live numbers; day-5 completion; the verb
            log carries every throttle with its actor
  needs:    scale-rig (targets can be synthetic; timing compressed via clock control where honest)
  evidence: —

S-FLEET-02 — 30M inventory: one campaign sustains the configured TPS for an hour, flat
  modules:  campaign, jobs, broker, store
  given:    30M synthetic targets; tps=2000; sized rig (the CI profile cannot host this)
  when:     release for 60 minutes under measurement
  then:     p95 release jitter within bound; store and broker headroom recorded; the numbers
            published as a bench report the way H6 benches are
  needs:    scale-rig — SPEC TO BE WRITTEN WITH THE OWNER before any claim
  evidence: —

S-FLEET-03 — Two campaigns under one GlobalTps never jointly exceed it
  modules:  campaign R1.4
  given:    GlobalTps=1000; two campaigns tps=800 each
  when:     both run concurrently
  then:     no one-second window releases >1000 across the pair (this is R1's own DoD,
            promoted to a story)
  needs:    local
  evidence: —

S-FIN-01 — A salary file with one bad row pays everyone except that row, after a second pair of eyes
  modules:  bulk, jobs, notification, console
  given:    a 10K-row payment file, row 4 121 refused by core banking at EXECUTION
            (validation-clean on purpose: an intake-invalid row BLOCKS the gate — that
            refusal is its own, already-proven story)
  when:     upload as payroll-clerk → validation report → payroll-SUPERVISOR approves →
            execute → the bad row's owner is notified (dedup-keyed per batch+row)
  then:     9 999 executed exactly once; row 4 121 in the repair queue with the refusal's
            own words; the approver identity stamped (DecidedBy) and the clerk durable in
            the jobs admin audit; the owner notified THROUGH the app's own
            failure→notification component (repair queue in, dedup-keyed request out —
            replaying it answers the same id, never a second mail), evidenced AND landed
            in a real inbox
  needs:    local (testcontainers: postgres + smtp4dev)
  evidence: tests/Goldpath.IntegrationTests/ScenarioFin01Tests.cs — replay with
            `dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~ScenarioFin01` (2026-08-06, 1m21s
            green: 10 000 rows, chunk 500, exactly-once by sink count AND distinct row
            numbers; the console half of the story is the smoke's four-eyes journey,
            which drives the SAME contract this scenario drives at the API)

S-FIN-02 — A litigation hold survives an erasure request, and the chain still verifies
  modules:  archival
  given:    an archived instruction under legal hold
  when:     a KVKK erasure arrives for it → refused; hold lifted → erasure runs
  then:     the refusal is explicit while held; after erasure the document is gone, the
            chain verifies, and the erasure receipt names actor+time
  needs:    local
  evidence: —

S-OPS-01 — The 03:00 incident: stop the world, fix, resume, answer for it
  modules:  jobs, console
  given:    a fleet mid-run
  when:     pause-all → verify nothing fires → resume-all → morning-after audit read
  then:     durable cluster-wide stop (survives a host restart while paused); the audit
            answers "who stopped the night"
  needs:    local
  evidence: —

S-OPS-02 — A mid-flight operator mistake is refused in the server's words, not a 500
  modules:  every admin surface
  given:    the live console
  when:     bad cron, unknown timezone, double-approve, erase-under-hold — each attempted
            from the SCREEN
  then:     every refusal arrives as the server's sentence in the UI; zero 500s
  needs:    local
  evidence: —

## Scale-rig note (for S-FLEET-02 class)

The CI reference profile proves mechanics, not telco scale. Before any 30M claim: the
owner and the agent write the rig spec TOGETHER (hardware, dataset shape, clock policy,
pass thresholds) into this file, and the run publishes its numbers like the H6 benches —
a claim without its rig spec does not get made.
