# Goldpath.Bulk

File/set intake — **L3 of the execution ladder**. A file becomes a validated, approved,
resumable run:

```
upload → parse (CSV v1) → per-row validation → report → APPROVE/REJECT gate → execute
                                                              │
                                                              └── as a Goldpath.Jobs run:
                                                                  chunked, checkpointed,
                                                                  repair queue + replay
```

## Wire it

```csharp
builder.AddGoldpathBulk<WebApplicationBuilder, OrdersDbContext>(bulk =>
{
    bulk.AddBatch<PaymentRow>("payments", b => b
        .Csv(c => c.Delimiter = ';')
        .MaxRows(50_000)                       // the ceiling is a decision, not a default
        .RowKey(r => r.EndToEndId)             // in-file duplicate = validation error
        .Validate((row, ctx) =>
        {
            if (row.Amount <= 0) ctx.Fail(nameof(row.Amount), "amount must be positive");
        }));
});
builder.Services.AddScoped<IGoldpathBulkRowHandler<PaymentRow>, PaymentRowHandler>();

builder.AddGoldpathJobs<WebApplicationBuilder, OrdersDbContext>(jobs =>
{
    jobs.ConnectionName = "ordersdb";
    jobs.AddGoldpathBulkJobs<OrdersDbContext>();    // validate + execute runs (cron safety nets)
});

// DbContext: modelBuilder.AddGoldpathBulk();  modelBuilder.AddGoldpathJobs();
```

## The guarantees

- **Content-hash dedup:** identical bytes return the SAME batch — a client retry storm
  cannot create a double-payment risk. A REJECTED file may be resubmitted deliberately.
- **The gate:** approval refuses invalid rows by default (`TolerateInvalidRows()` opts
  into executing the valid subset — the report is the evidence of what was skipped).
  Rejection requires a reason. Every decision carries the actor.
- **Value-free reports:** row errors carry row + field + message, never the offending
  value — classified data stays out of reports by construction; the raw file is the
  evidence, with `DeleteFileAfter` retention.
- **At-most-once-or-repair:** the executing chunk CLAIMS rows (persisted) before any
  side effect. A row claimed but never stamped was interrupted mid-flight — it goes to
  the repair queue for a human-confirmed replay instead of being silently re-sent.
- **Row failures don't stop the batch:** they land in the jobs repair queue; the jobs
  `replay-items` verb retries them through your handler; the last cleared failure flips
  the batch to Completed.

Ops surface (admin API, metrics panel, runbooks) ships in S2; run views live in the JOBS
console today — a bulk execution IS a jobs run.
