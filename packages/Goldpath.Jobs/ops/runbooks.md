# Goldpath.Jobs — runbooks (jobs RFC §8: runbook or it didn't happen)

Every procedure below is scriptable through the admin API (`/goldpath/admin/jobs`) — the
dashboard and the AI skills use the SAME verbs, and every verb writes an audit row.

## 1. Stuck run (progress stopped)

**Signal:** `goldpath_jobs_checkpoint_age_seconds` grows; run detail shows chunks `Claimed` and
none completing.

1. `GET /fleets` — is the claiming node still checking in? (`nodes[].lastCheckin`)
2. **Node dead** (last check-in older than the misfire threshold): do NOTHING — Quartz
   clustering re-fires with recovery on a healthy node within the threshold and the runner
   resumes from the checkpoint; stale claims reset automatically. Verify: run detail shows
   progress again; `run.executions` incremented.
3. **Node alive but the chunk hangs** (bug/downstream outage): the chunk's claim holds
   until the node restarts. Fix the downstream, then restart the worker POD (graceful:
   the current chunk drains or times out; the next fire resumes). Never delete run rows.
4. If the schedule window passed meanwhile, see §4 (misfire).

## 2. Poisoned item / failed chunk (repair queue)

**Signal:** `goldpath_jobs_item_failures_total` climbs or a run ends `Failed` with
`failedChunks > 0`; the run continued past them BY DESIGN.

1. `GET /runs/{id}` — read `openFailures[].reason`; fix the data/root cause.
2. Item-level: `POST /runs/{id}/replay-items` — replays open items through the job's
   `IGoldpathItemReplay` hook on an executor. A job without the hook fails the replay LOUDLY:
   add the hook, redeploy, replay again. Replayed items get `redrivenAt` stamped.
3. Chunk-level (run `Failed`): `POST /runs/{id}/rerun` starts a FRESH run over the full
   plan — safe only because job work must be idempotent per item (the platform rule);
   refuse the urge to hand-edit chunk rows.

## 3. Mid-run deploy / input version pinning

A run captures `inputVersion` at start (`PinInput`). Deploying a new tariff/config during
a run does NOT change the running run's inputs — chunks read the pinned version from
`context.InputVersion`. After the deploy: let the run finish, then `rerun` if the new
input must apply retroactively. The run row shows which version it used — the audit answer
to "which tariff billed this?".

## 4. Missed schedule window (misfire)

Quartz applies the trigger's misfire policy after `MisfireThreshold` (default 60s):
cron triggers default to FIRE-ONCE-NOW then continue on schedule. If the window matters
more than the execution (a 01:30 EOD that must NOT run at 09:00), pause the job before
maintenance (`POST .../pause`) and `resume` + `trigger` deliberately after. Check
`GET /fleets/{f}/jobs` → `triggers[].nextFireAt` to confirm the schedule re-armed.

## 5. Counter / cache reconciliation (MDM constraint #3)

Fast counters (an L4 policy engine's TPS/quota) are CACHE; the run tables are TRUTH.
After a cache loss: recompute from `GoldpathJobRuns`/`GoldpathJobRunChunks` (completed chunk × plan
density) before resuming paced work — never trust a freshly-warmed counter that says 0.

## 6. Fleet-wide stop (incident brake)

`POST /fleets/{f}/pause-all` pauses EVERY trigger in the fleet through the store — all
nodes obey on their next poll; running chunks drain and checkpoint. `resume-all` re-arms.
Both audited; both visible in `GET /audit`.

## 7. Graceful shutdown / deploy of a worker

SIGTERM → the hosted service waits for the running chunk, checkpoints, releases the fire.
The run stays OPEN and the next fire (schedule, recovery, or a manual `trigger`) resumes
it. Proven by the kill/resume integration tests — a deploy during a run costs at most one
in-flight chunk's repetition.

## 8. First deploy of a brand-new store (cold-boot contention)

Multiple executor nodes booting SIMULTANEOUSLY against an EMPTY `qrtz_` schema can contend
on the store's own lock bootstrap and stall before "scheduler started". Rolling deploys
never hit this (nodes join one at a time — Kubernetes' default maxSurge behaves); for a
first-ever deploy, bring ONE node up before scaling out. Once the store has lived a single
check-in cycle, concurrent (re)starts are ordinary cluster behavior. Found by the
kill-9 integration proof and pinned by its staggered-start arrangement.
