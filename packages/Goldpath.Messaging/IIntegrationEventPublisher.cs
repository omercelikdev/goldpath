/// <para>WHY this exists, written down so it is never mistaken for ceremony: a command
/// handler is the code an adopter writes most, and until now the template put
/// <c>IPublishEndpoint</c> — a MassTransit type — straight into its constructor. That made
/// the library part of every adopter's own signature, so a future transport change (the
/// 8.x maintenance window is finite; see
/// <c>docs/rfc/goldpath-messaging-exit.md</c>) would have edited THEIR code, not just ours.
/// With zero adopters today, moving that line costs nothing; with N adopters it costs N
/// migrations.</para>
///
/// <para>What this is NOT: a message-bus abstraction. ADR-0003 forbids rewriting what the
/// ecosystem provides, and the implementation is a one-line delegation to
/// <c>IPublishEndpoint</c> — no retry policy, no topology, no routing decisions of our own.
/// The CONSUME side deliberately stays on the library's types: a consumer genuinely uses
/// its pipeline (headers, retry, redelivery, tenant restore), and wrapping that would be a
/// leaky abstraction that costs more than the migration it saves.</para>
