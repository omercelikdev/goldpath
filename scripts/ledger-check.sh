# The ledgers claim things about GitHub issues; an audit (2026-08-09) found them drifting
# in BOTH directions — open-threads said #98/#72 were closed while both were open, and
# GAP-LEDGER said #32/#33/#34 were open while all three had closed three weeks earlier.
# The asset's core promise is "nothing is postponed without landing in a ledger"; a ledger
# nobody cross-checks is worse than none, because it is trusted.
#
# This asserts the one thing a human cannot keep straight: every issue a ledger REFERENCES
# must have the state the ledger implies. Rules:
#   - a row saying "ISSUE #n" / "tracked in #n"  → #n must be OPEN
#   - a row saying "closed"/"CLOSED"/"RESOLVED" beside #n → #n must be CLOSED
