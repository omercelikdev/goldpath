# Mutation gates — what is scored, what is excluded, and why

One config per package (`Goldpath.<Package>.json`), all at the same thresholds: high 85,
low 75, **break 70** — `scripts/mutation-gate.sh <Package>` runs one, the nightly matrix
runs the hosted-fit set, `mutation-heavy.yml` the six long-running ones. Stryker JSON
cannot carry comments, so every `mutate` exclusion and every `ignore-methods` entry is
justified HERE (ADR-0005: suppression is visible and justified at every layer). An
exclusion without a row below is a finding.

## Excluded files

## Measured scores

The release checklist requires "mutation scores current for every package whose engine
paths changed"; until 2026-09-05 no score was written down anywhere, so the gate could be
checked only by the person who ran it. This table is that record. A score here is a FULL
run (`scripts/mutation-gate.sh <Package>`), never a `--since` diff run.

**Measured 2026-09-05**, full runs on the hosted-fit sixteen (macOS, 10 cores; the last
eight at `GOLDPATH_MUTATION_CONCURRENCY=9`, which roughly halved their wall clock).

| Package | Score | Margin over break (70) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Abstractions | 95.24 % | 25.24 |
| Cli | 93.19 % | 23.19 |
| SoftDelete | 91.67 % | 21.67 |
| Locking | 91.67 % | 21.67 |
| Messaging | 84.34 % | 14.34 |
| AuditTrail | 81.97 % | 11.97 |
| DataProtection | 78.95 % | 8.95 |
| Data | 77.38 % | 7.38 |
| FileExchange | 76.92 % | 6.92 |
| Approvals | 75.82 % | 5.82 |
| Console | 75.00 % | 5.00 |
| MultiTenancy | 74.42 % | 4.42 |
| Idempotency | 73.58 % | 3.58 |
| Analyzers | 72.67 % | 2.67 |
| ServiceDefaults | 72.15 % | 2.15 |
| Auth | 70.65 % | **0.65** |

Read the margin column, not the score. Four packages clear the break by less than four
points — **Auth by 0.65**, ServiceDefaults by 2.15, Analyzers by 2.67 and Idempotency by
3.58 — so in those four a single deleted or weakened test turns the gate red. That fact was invisible until
this table existed: the checklist asked for scores and nothing recorded one. Treat a
margin under 2 as a standing invitation to add facts, not as a passing grade.

The six long-running packages (Jobs, Archival, Bulk, Notification, Campaign, Caching) run
in `mutation-heavy.yml` (dispatch-only) and are measured locally before a release; their
rows join this table at the next such run.

| Package | Excluded file | Why it is not scored |
|---|---|---|
| Jobs | `GoldpathJobsExtensions.cs` | DI composition — registrations and option binding; behavior lives in the registered types, which ARE scored. |
| Jobs | `QuartzStoreModel.cs` | EF model mapping for Quartz's own tables — declarative; a mutated column name fails the migration proofs, not a unit test. |
| Jobs | `GoldpathQuartzAdapter.cs` | The Quartz adapter — exercised only with a live scheduler (the integration suite and the console smoke), which Stryker's unit loop does not host. |
| Jobs | `GoldpathJobHistoryListener.cs` | Quartz listener callbacks — same live-scheduler dependency. |
| Jobs | `GoldpathJobsFleetRegistry.cs` | Cluster-member registry over Quartz metadata — live-scheduler dependency. |
| Jobs | `GoldpathJobsAdminEndpoints.cs` | Minimal-API route table over the admin service; the contract is pinned by the route-freeze test and the console smoke. |
| Jobs | `GoldpathJobsAdminService.cs` | The admin verbs (trigger/pause/reschedule/calendars/rerun/replay) run through the LIVE scheduler and the fleet registry — the same dependency that excludes the adapter and the registry. MEASURED 2026-09-03: scoring it drops the package below the break (the unit loop cannot host the scheduler, so its 738 lines survive by construction). It is proven where the scheduler exists: `JobsClusterTests`, `JobsRunListTests`, `BulkClusterTests` and the console smoke's journeys drive every verb against real Postgres + Quartz. |
| FileExchange | `GoldpathFileExchangeMetrics.cs` | Meter declarations (see Campaign/Notification); joined 2026-09-03 with the admin surface. |
| Archival | `GoldpathArchivalExtensions.cs` | DI composition (see Jobs) — the archival engine, policy and store ARE scored. |
| Archival | `GoldpathArchivalAdminEndpoints.cs` | Route table (see Jobs); the contract is pinned by the admin-contract check and the console smoke. |
| Archival | `GoldpathArchivalMetrics.cs` | Meter declarations — names pinned by the dashboard's queries, not by mutants. |
| Bulk | `GoldpathBulkExtensions.cs` | DI composition (see Jobs) — the batch engine, row handlers and approval gate ARE scored. |
| Bulk | `GoldpathBulkAdminEndpoints.cs` | Route table (see Jobs). |
| Bulk | `GoldpathBulkMetrics.cs` | Meter declarations. |
| Cli | `Program.cs` | The process entry point — three lines that hand argv to `CliRunner.Run`, which IS scored end to end. |
| Cli | `ConsoleProcessRunner.cs` | The real `IProcessRunner` — it starts `dotnet`/`specdrift` and returns the exit code; every command under test drives the fake, and the real one is exercised by the nightly golden-manifest shapes and `validate-migrations.sh`. |
| Analyzers | `Descriptors.cs` | 49 `DiagnosticDescriptor` initialisers — id, title, message format, severity and help link, with no branching. A mutant here changes a STRING, and the strings are pinned where they are read: every rule's id and message are asserted by `Goldpath.Analyzers.Tests`, and the release-tracking analyzer (RS2000/RS2007) fails the build if an id leaves the release files. Mutating them would only manufacture survivors the tests already cover from the other side. |
| Cli | `Prompter.cs` | The interactive shell (`Console.ReadLine` + menu rendering) behind `IPrompter` — a unit loop cannot answer a prompt. The wizard's QUESTIONS, defaults and multi-select parsing are pinned against a recording fake in `WizardDiscoverRunnerMutationTests`; the derivation it feeds is a pure function under full mutation. **Weakest exclusion in this ledger** (open-threads: no e2e run drives the real prompter either). |
| Campaign | `GoldpathCampaignExtensions.cs` | DI composition (see Jobs). |
| Campaign | `GoldpathCampaignMetrics.cs` | Meter/counter declarations — names are pinned by the dashboard's queries, not by mutants. |
| Campaign | `GoldpathCampaignConsumers.cs` | MassTransit consumers — exercised against a real broker in the integration suite. |
| Campaign | `GoldpathCampaignAdminEndpoints.cs` | Route table (see Jobs). |
| Notification | `GoldpathNotificationExtensions.cs` | DI composition. |
| Notification | `GoldpathNotificationMetrics.cs` | Meter declarations. |
| Notification | `GoldpathNotificationChannels.cs` | SMTP/channel transports — exercised against a real Mailpit in the integration suite. |
| Notification | `GoldpathNotificationAdminEndpoints.cs` | Route table. |

Everything else in a scored package is mutated — including the admin services of the
modules whose engines are in-process (Approvals, FileExchange, Notification's reads); the
Jobs admin service is the exception above, and the reason is measured, not assumed.

## Ignored methods

| Package | Method pattern | Why |
|---|---|---|
| all | `Log*` | Logging calls carry no behavior a test can observe; mutating them only manufactures survivors. Declared in EVERY config since 2026-09-05 — eleven of them carried the ledger's word without the setting until the preview.8 coverage audit. |
| Locking | `CreateRedisProvider` | Builds the Redis lock provider — needs a live Redis, which the unit loop does not host; the Redis path is proven by the integration suite. |

## Packages without a gate

`ApiDefaults`, `Locking.SqlServer`, `Sdk` — composition and adapter shells with little
branching logic; each has a unit suite. A gate joins the moment one of them grows an engine
path (the 2026-09-01 audit's rule). `Console`, `Messaging` and `ServiceDefaults` gained
gates on 2026-09-03 (the thin-suites PR): each carries real branching (asset resolution,
the publish/consume filters, correlation + concurrency guard) that a unit suite can score.
